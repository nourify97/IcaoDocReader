# IcaoDocReader Android App

## Overview

**IcaoDocReader** is an Android app designed to decode and extract key information from ICAO-compliant documents, such as passports, national ID cards, and other travel-related documents. Currently, the app allows users to manually input document details for decoding. Future update will include an automatic MRZ (Machine Readable Zone) scanning feature for faster and more efficient data acquisition.

## Supported Documents

- Passports (ICAO standard)
- National ID cards

## How to Use

1. Open the **IcaoDocReader** app on your Android device.
2. Manually enter the document details (passport number, date of birth, expiry date, etc.).
3. Use the device's NFC reader to scan the document.
4. The app will then decode the document details and display key information, including:
    - Picture
    - Name
    - Gender
    - Nationality
    - State

## Privacy and Security

- All data processed within **IcaoDocReader** is handled **locally** on your device, with no data stored externally.
- **No personal or document data is sent externally**.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that the document details are entered accurately to avoid decoding errors.
- The app has been tested with **Italian passports** and **ID cards**, and decoding works correctly in both cases.
